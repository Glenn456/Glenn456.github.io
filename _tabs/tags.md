Hello, I'm Glenn Ongalo
Welcome to Beyond Offensive Security, where I explore the full spectrum of cybersecurity operations. I'm a junior security professional based in Mombasa, Kenya, with a passion for protecting organizations from evolving cyber threats.
What I Do
My focus spans three critical areas of security operations:
Incident Response — When breaches happen, every second counts. I'm dedicated to developing rapid response capabilities, analyzing security incidents, and helping organizations recover quickly while strengthening their defenses.
Threat Hunting — I believe the best defense is proactive. I spend time searching for hidden threats, analyzing suspicious patterns, and uncovering adversaries before they can cause damage.
Penetration Testing — Understanding how attackers think is crucial. I conduct security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and help organizations patch weaknesses before they're exploited.
My Journey
My path into cybersecurity has been driven by one core belief: organizations deserve strong, reliable protection against cyber threats. Every day, I'm learning new techniques, exploring emerging threats, and working to sharpen my skills across the security landscape.
The field of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, and I'm committed to evolving with it. Through hands-on practice, continuous learning, and real-world experience, I'm building the expertise needed to make a meaningful impact in security operations.
